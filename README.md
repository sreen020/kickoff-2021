# Minor Web Design & Development Kickoff 2021

## Concept üåê
When i heard about this assignment I immediately thought about a sport project.  At first I wanted to do something with fighting sports but the API I needed costed money (yeah I‚Äôm Dutch). When I continued my search I came across a NBA API (basketball). I‚Äôve never played basketball but I like watching it and I know there‚Äôs a lot of data monitored each game. <br>
<br>
My concept was born. I found a great API that gives me acces to games, stats, teams and players. Using this data I can and I will make a sick web app!<br>
<br>
With the data from the API I can make pages for each individual game. When the user presses on one of the games it will show to winner and the scoreboard. From the homepage there will be a functionality to filter to select your favorite team. This will show to record of your favo team only. This is pretty difficult for me to build. I have a little coding experience but not that much. I will give everything this weeks to make the app I‚Äôve got in mind!
