# Minor Web Design & Development Kickoff 2021

## Description 🌐
When i heard about this assignment I immediately thought about a sport project.  At first I wanted to do something with fighting sports but the API I needed costed money (yeah I’m Dutch). When I continued my search I came across a NBA API (basketball). I’ve never played basketball but I like watching it and I know there’s a lot of data monitored each game. <br>
<br>
My concept was born. I found a great API that gives me acces to games, stats, teams and players. Using this data I can and I will make a sick web app!<br>
